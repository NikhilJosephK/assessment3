            The voice of customer is a methodology that has gained immense momentum
            across businesses worldwide. With VoC, you can extract the expectations
            of your customers, directly and indirectly. Market research, focus
            groups, email surveys, and the likes fall under direct interaction which
            helps to gather customer views at every touch-point while online
            reviews, social media helps to keep up-to-date with customer
            expectations and trends without much direct interaction.

                        Furthermore, your voice of customer software must capture customer
                        data real-time, instantaneously. Waiting for results for hours makes
